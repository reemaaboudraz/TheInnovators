# The Innovators — Concordia Campus Guide App

Welcome to the Innovators Repository!  

We are a team of undergraduate Software Engineering students building a next-generation Campus Guide App as part of our Mini-Capstone project. Our mission is to set a new standard for campus navigation and student experience across both the Sir George Williams and Loyola campuses.

Our goal is to deliver a fast, intuitive, and scalable mobile platform that supports both indoor and outdoor navigation, simplifies campus movement, and connects students to all the resources they need — all in one place.

This repository will evolve as we rapidly iterate, ship new features, and continuously improve usability and performance.
